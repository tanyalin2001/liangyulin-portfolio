  <h1>Experience</h1>

  <!-- Lock It Lending -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Software Engineer Contractor – Lock It Lending</h2>
    <p>Developed and deployed the company's production website, handling UI/UX, frontend logic, and backend integration. 
    Implemented a CI/CD pipeline to streamline testing and deployment.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- NASA KBR / LZ Technology -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>NASA / KBR & LZ Technology – Software Engineer Intern</h2>

    <p>Supported automated testing for NASA’s ECLSS and related systems. I took over a testing pipeline that had been stalled due to logging limitations, missing parameters, and restricted commands, then restored and expanded its functionality.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Identified gaps where certain flight software commands and PUI parameters could not be captured or tested, documented these limitations, and communicated what could and could not be validated moving forward.</li>
      <li>Resolved logging issues by finding a workaround tool to bypass blocked commands, enabling correct data capture for verification.</li>
      <li>Addressed simulation tool issues where some malfunctions could not be simulated, adding missing steps to ensure proper logging and validation.</li>
      <li>Implemented a two-step validation approach: sending commands, then manually setting valve/position states to ensure the simulation tool could capture the expected behavior.</li>
      <li>Upgraded the SSRT validation process from “end-only checking” to step-by-step verification (valve states, light indicators, transitions), improving accuracy and test reliability.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- Odyssey Space Research -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Odyssey Space Research – Software Engineer Intern</h2>

    <p>Worked on the implementation and testing of flight software tools for Sierra Space’s Dream Chaser spaceplane. 
    My focus was on the tools team, developing monitoring and analytics features to track performance and diagnose issues efficiently.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Resolved tool-related tickets and deployed new features in Pan, an internal tool used for software monitoring.</li>
      <li>Implemented unit tests in Pypan using Python <code>unittest</code> and <code>mock.patch</code>, improving code quality and ensuring correct behavior for HDF5 data rollup functions.</li>
      <li>Identified and fixed bugs in the Pan requirements page to improve user experience.</li>
      <li>Implemented dynamic PDF generation from real-time HTML content using HTML-to-Canvas + jsPDF, handling pagination and asynchronous data rendering.</li>
